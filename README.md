### How to install it
Clone the repo or download + extract it, spin up a terminal/shell (I've only tested this on Windows), navigate to the top level 'okcscrape3' folder and use pip to install with the following command:
```
py -m pip install .
```
Or just however you access pip, which would essentially be:
```
<prefix to get to pip> pip install .
```
Here's an example of what that looks like:

If the 'Scripts' folder of the Python 3 installation on which you just installed okcscrape3 is on your %PATH%, you can simply install the package and call the app by typing 'okcscrape3' in the command prompt.

I haven't comprehensively tested the installation process, so let me know if you run into issues.
